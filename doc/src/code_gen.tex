\section{Code generator}
\label{Code generator}

Code generator is implemented in the \verb|code_generator.c| module with the corresponding header file \\ \verb|code_generator.h|.
There is no optimizer implemented in the project. Supportive functions are called from the parser or expression modules. The generator utilizes the stack which greatly reduces the number of generated compiler variables. Most constructions are generated directly, the exception being declarations inside a cycle. Declaration of variables inside loops is overridden on assignments. Inside the cycle, everything except for variable declarations is stored in a buffer, while declarations are written directly to \texttt{stdout}, after the end of the cycle, the entire content of the buffer is written to \texttt{stdout}, this is done to prevent variable redeclarations.
