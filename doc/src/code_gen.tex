\section{Code generator}
\label{Code generator}

Lexical analyzer is implemented in module \verb|code_generator.c| with the corresponding header file \\ \verb|code_generator.h|.
There is no optimizer implemented in the project. Supportive functions are called from semantic analyzer and precedential analyzer. The code generator works with the stack and thanks to that there is not generated large number of compiler variables. We are able to generate most constructions directly, the exception is the declaration inside a cycle. Declaration of variables inside loops is overridden on assignments.Inside the cycle, everything that is not a variable declaration is stored in the buffer, variable declarations are written directly to stdout, after the end of the cycle, the entire content of the buffer is written to stdout, this will prevent re-declaration of variables.
